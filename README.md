# LudiiRecs
In this repository i am going to create a recommender system for coding in the Ludii general game system. The Ludii GGS is part of the Digital Ludeme Project, which under the leadership of C. Browne received a 2mâ‚¬ [![ERC Consolidator Grant](https://erc.europa.eu/news/erc-2017-consolidator-grants-results)] (#771292). I am a second year Bachelors studnt at the University Maastricht, where I study Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and particpate in the Honours programme of said study. I chose the research based MaRBLe 2.0 branch of the Honours programme, which enabled me to work on the Digital Ludeme Project under the supervision of C. Browne and his team.

## Features
- Parser of the Ludii language: Builds tree objects from .lud files that represent the structure of the game file
- Algorithm to gather all .lud files
- Example: Graph resulting from parsing [Tic-Tac-Toe.lud](https://github.com/frehburg/LudiiRecs/blob/main/res/Tic-Tac-Toe.lud), metadata is also getting parsed but not visualized in this example.

## Planning
- Statistical analysis of all .lud files to enable first recommendation
- Improve recommendations

## Installation
To install this project you will need
- [Java](https://www.java.com/) - Java JDK 15 or newer
- To install Java follow this [guide](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Apache Maven
- To install Maven follow this [guide](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/)
- Open the project in your favorite IDE as a maven project
- run `mvn package` on command line in the directory C:/.../LudiiRecs/ to install all dependencies
Now you are ready to go

## Run
After installing, the program can be run in the following way:
1. Go to `TreeGenerator.java`
2. In `main()` set the path of `File f` to the .lud file that you want to parse
3. Execute `TreeGenerator.main()` 
4. The tree built from the .lud file will be printed into the console
